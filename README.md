# 9kmmrbot

9kmmrbot is a Dota 2-focused Twitch chat bot.

It features many commands that provide information about the ongoing match and other details
about the streamer's Dota 2 profile.

Anyone can request 9kmmrbot to join their channel's chatroom.

## Setting up

This project can be spun up easily using Docker. Review `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to see
how the containers are created. Simply execute the following command from within the project directory
to start the bot:

```
docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

You might need to `sudo` the above command, or add your user to the appropriate `docker` user group. Refer
to the Docker documentation.

In order for the above command to succeed, a `vars.env` file must be present in the project root directory. This
file contains the various environment variables required for the bot to connect to Twitch, Steam and MongoDB.

```
MONGODB_URL=
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=
TWITCH_AUTH=
STEAM_USERNAME=
STEAM_PASSWORD=
STEAM_WEBAPI_KEY=
NODE_ENV=
```

* By default, the `MONGODB_URL` should be `mongodb://mongo:27017/{db name}` unless you change the Docker settings.
* The auth token you obtain for the Twitch client should have the `chat:read` and `chat:edit` scopes.
* If you want the bot to write the output in Twitch chat and not just in the console, set `NODE_ENV` to `production`.

Of course, you can always manually start the bot by starting a MongoDB instance and running `node index`. You still
need to set all the environment variables listed above.

## Commands

Before the bot can respond to any commands in your channel, you must request for it to join your channel.

* In the bot's channel, write `!join`
* In your channel, write `!9kmmrbot addacc STEAMID`, where `STEAMID` is your own.

You can link up to 10 Steam IDs to your channel in this way.

Below is a list of commonly used commands. This is not a comprehensive list because some commands are
